# üè• Healthcare Data Analysis using SQL

## üìò Project Overview
This project simulates a **real-world healthcare analytics system** built entirely in **MySQL**.  
It focuses on cleaning, structuring, and analyzing hospital-related data to generate valuable insights for better decision-making.

The dataset represents hospital operations, including **patients, providers, departments, diagnosis, insurance, visits, procedures, and city information**.  
Since the raw data did not include relationships or constraints, the project involved creating a **complete relational schema** with **primary keys, foreign keys, and data cleaning processes**.

After data modeling, **31 analytical SQL queries** were developed to uncover insights related to:
- Patient demographics and trends  
- Treatment costs by department and diagnosis  
- Repeat patients and emergency cases  
- Yearly and monthly visit trends  
- Average hospital stay duration  
- Department and insurance performance metrics  

This project demonstrates end-to-end **data analysis, modeling, and reporting** capabilities using SQL ‚Äî reflecting tasks commonly performed by **Data Analysts and BI professionals** in the healthcare domain.

## üéØ Project Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Standardize inconsistent column names for clarity.  
   - Convert date fields using `STR_TO_DATE()` for proper formatting.  
   - Replace blank fields with `NULL` values.  
   - Ensure all data types are correctly defined (e.g., `INT`, `DATE`, `VARCHAR`).  
   - Add derived columns (e.g., `Age_Category`) for segmentation.

2. **Database Design & Relationships**
   - Design a **Star Schema** where:
     - `visits` ‚Üí Fact table  
     - `patients`, `providers`, `departments`, `diagnosis`, `insurance`, `procedures`, and `cities` ‚Üí Dimension tables  
   - Define **Primary Keys** for dimension tables.  
   - Link tables with **Foreign Keys** in the fact table for referential integrity.  

3. **Data Validation & Quality Checks**
   - Detect and remove duplicate records.  
   - Identify and replace blank or null entries.  
   - Check data completeness and logical consistency (e.g., valid age, admission/discharge dates).  

4. **Analytical SQL Querying**
   - Derive KPIs such as patient count, total cost, average stay duration, and treatment trends.  
   - Perform segmentation by age category, diagnosis, insurance provider, and department.  
   - Identify repeat patients, pending discharges, and emergency cases.  
   - Generate yearly and monthly performance summaries.
